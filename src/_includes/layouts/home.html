  <p>I’m a junior front-end developer looking for a new role in an exciting company.
  I focus on writing accessible HTML, using modern CSS practices and writing clean
  JavaScript. When writing JavaScript code, I mostly use React, but I can adapt to
  whatever tools are required. I’m based in London, UK, but I’m happy working remotely
  and have experience in remote teams. When I’m not coding, you’ll find me outdoors.
  I love being out in nature whether that’s going for a walk, run or cycling. I’d love
  you to check out my work.</p>
