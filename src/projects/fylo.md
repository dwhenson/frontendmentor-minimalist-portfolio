title: "Fylo"
summary:
  " This project was built in pure HTML and CSS. I had mobile and desktop designs to
  work to and built it so that it was fully-responsive. I took a mobile-first approach
  and used modern CSS like Flexbox and Grid for layout purposes."

  "This project was a front-end  challenge from Frontend Mentor. It’s a platform that
  enables you to practice building websites to a design and project brief. Each challenge
  includes mobile and desktop designs to show how the website should look at different
  screen sizes. Creating these projects has helped me refine my workflow and solve
  real-world coding problems. I’ve learned something new with each project, helping
  me to improve and adapt my style."
